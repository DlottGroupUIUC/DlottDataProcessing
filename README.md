# DlottDataProcessing
 Data Processing Package for matlab for use in PDV and PMT/temperature analysis, PDV processing currently only has velocity calculations, but can do so with either STFT or Peak finding algorithms. Currently not fully debugged, so use at your own peril.
 
 To use, go to repo folder and run launcher.m, rest will work fine. Save data has a database of various parameters such as scope delay that can be changed. Do so BEFORE running the program.
